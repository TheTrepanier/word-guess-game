## Who's that Pokémon?!

The player will be presented with the silhouette of a pokemon. There will be a serise of underscores to show the number of letters in the pokemon's name, this will be displayed to the right of the silhouette on large to x-large screens, and on moblie devices it will be displayed below.

In this game I will be communicating with the [pokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html)
I will be using jQuery to 'GET' information about a randomly selected Pokémon, specifically I will need the value stored in the name and, front_default keys
