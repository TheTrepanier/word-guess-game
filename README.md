## Who's that Pokémon?!

The player will be presented with the sprite of a pokemon. There will be a series of underscores to show the number of letters in the pokemon's name.

In this game I will be communicating with the [pokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html)
I will 'GET' the information about a randomly selected Pokémon, specifically I will need the value stored in the name and, front_default keys
